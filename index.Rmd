# Activity 1
The most *useful* aspect of this class is how it has shaped the way I view data. Like most other people, I consume data every day and they inform decisions I make like the movie I'm watching or the person I'm voting for. But, there is so much more to data than meets the eye. More than anything, this class has taught me to be a smart consumer of data and driven me to find solutions myself through using data.
